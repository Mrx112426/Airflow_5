",2002-09-10,"A thunderstorm, lightning, a bright star and a bright planet all graced an evening sky for a short while near Bismarck, North Dakota, USA two weeks ago.  Thick thunderclouds from a passing storm are the origin of a strong cloud to ground lightning strike.  Small areas of rain darken portions of the orange sunset, visible at the horizon above the vast prairie.  The planet Venus peeks below the clouds on the lower left of the image.  Blue sky shines high above the distant storm, streaked with high white cirrus clouds.  The bright star Arcturus glitters near the image top, just left of center.  Just a few minutes later, only a memory and this picture remained.",https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0209/venusstorms_anderson_big.jpg,image,v1,Venus Beyond the Storm,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0209/venusstorms_anderson.jpg
Steve Milne,2018-10-25,"Light-years across, this suggestive shape known as the Seahorse Nebula appears in silhouette against a rich, luminous background of stars. Seen toward the royal northern constellation of Cepheus, the dusty, obscuring clouds are part of a Milky Way molecular cloud some 1,200 light-years distant. It is also listed as Barnard 150 (B150), one of 182 dark markings of the sky cataloged in the early 20th century by astronomer E. E. Barnard. Packs of low mass stars are forming within from collapsing cores only visible at long infrared wavelengths. Still, colorful stars in Cepheus add to the pretty, galactic skyscape.",https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1810/Milne_B150_FIN_APOD2048.jpg,image,v1,Barnard 150: Seahorse in Cepheus,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1810/Milne_B150_FIN_APOD1024.jpg
Martin Pugh,2014-11-28,"Look through the cosmic cloud cataloged as NGC 281 and you might miss the stars of open cluster IC 1590. But, formed within the nebula, that cluster's young, massive stars ultimately power the pervasive nebular glow. The eye-catching shapes looming in this portrait of NGC 281 are sculpted columns and dense dust globules seen in silhouette, eroded by intense, energetic winds and radiation from the hot cluster stars. If they survive long enough, the dusty structures could also be sites of future star formation. Playfully called the Pacman Nebula because of its overall shape, NGC 281 is about 10,000 light-years away in the constellation Cassiopeia. This sharp composite image was made through narrow-band filters, combining emission from the nebula's hydrogen, sulfur, and oxygen atoms in green, red, and blue hues. It spans over 80 light-years at the estimated distance of NGC 281.",https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1411/NGC281_STXL11002_AOXPugh.jpg,image,v1,Portrait of NGC 281,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1411/NGC281_STXL11002_AOXPugh950.jpg

",2010-06-08,"A new rocket, the Falcon 9, was launched successfully from Cape Canaveral, Florida, USA, last week. The Falcon 9, standing about as high as a 15-floor building, was developed by the commercial SpaceX corporation as a step toward a relatively inexpensive space launch system. Falcon 9's success follows successful launches of the Falcon 1 last year. Pictured above, a movie of the Falcon 9's launch includes an insect, the launch as viewed from far away, and images from the side of the vehicle which include the separation of the lower stage. When topped with SpaceX's Dragon Cargo or Crew capsule, the Falcon 9 may be used to lift satellites and astronauts to low Earth orbit and the International Space Station in the coming decade.",,other,v1,Falcon 9 Launches to Orbit,

",2022-04-18,"The mission was to document night-flying birds -- but it ended up also documenting a beautiful sky. The featured wide-angle mosaic was taken over the steppe golden fields in MÃ©rtola, Portugal in 2020. From such a dark location, an immediately-evident breathtaking glow arched over the night sky: the central band of our Milky Way galaxy.  But this sky had much more. Thin clouds crossed the sky like golden ribbons. The planet Mars appeared on the far left, while the planets Saturn and Jupiter were also simultaneously visible -- but on the opposite side of the sky, here seen on the far right.  Near the top of the image the bright star Vega can be found, while the far-distant and faint Andromeda Galaxy can be seen toward the left, just below Milky Way's arch.  As the current month progresses, several planets are lining up in the pre-dawn sky: Jupiter, Venus, Mars, and Saturn.   Did you know?
